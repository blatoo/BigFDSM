# Fixed Degree Sequence Model(FDSM) for big data

An Algorithms which calculated the similarity beween items. 

FDSM is often applied by the recommend system for finding the hidden pattern with high accuracy. The main problem of this algorithm is high computational effort.

This code tuned this algorithm with different variation.

`BigFDSM/src/algo/` are the main algorithms, `LevFDSM.java` is the original FDSM, the rest java files are variations of FDSM.
